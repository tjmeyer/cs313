               <p>I've been interested in computers for as long as I can remember. My wife and I own a <a href="http://www.ignispc.com/" target="_blank">small
               business</a> in town that helps people with their computers and I love every minute of it!</p>
               <h3>I plan to...</h3>
               <p>I am studying both Computer Science and Medicine currently. Eventually I plan to use my knowledge
               to continue helping people by working as law enforcement. It's really the perfect mix of all of my passions: computers,
               health/fitness, guns, and fast cars!
               </p>
               <h3>I'm Married...</h3>
               <p>My wife, Stephanie, yes, Stephanie Meyer, is the love my life. She is currently attending University of Cincinnati 
               to become a DNP (Doctor Nurse Practitioner) of Midwifery. She is currently working as a Labor and Delivery Nurse at
               Madison Memorial Hospital. If you've recently had a baby, then I'm sure you've met her.</p>
